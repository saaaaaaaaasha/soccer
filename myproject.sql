Конечно, возникают некоторые вопросы, связанные с использованием Lorem ipsum на сайтах и проектах, ориентированных на кириллический контент &ndash; написание символов на латыни и на кириллице значительно различается.<br />\r\n	И даже с языками, использующими латинский алфавит, могут возникнуть небольшие проблемы: в различных языках те или иные буквы встречаются с разной частотой, имеется разница в длине наиболее распространенных слов. Отсюда напрашивается вывод, что все же лучше использовать в качестве &laquo;рыбы&raquo; текст на том языке, который планируется использовать при запуске проекта.
